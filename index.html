            <h3>Satay Trivia</h3>

                    <summary>When did satay first appear in Malaysia?</summary>
                    <p>Although both Thailand and Malaysia claim it as their own, its Southeast Asian origin was in Java, Indonesia. There satay was developed from the Indian kebab brought by the Muslim traders. Even India cannot claim its origin, for there it was a legacy of Middle Eastern influence.</p>
                    <p>In the 19th century, satay made its way here into Malaysia through Straits of Malacca. It was believed that satay was first introduced by a man named Haji Tasmin Bin Sakiban who came from Indonesia to Kajang in 1914. The satay business established two years after his arrival.</p>
